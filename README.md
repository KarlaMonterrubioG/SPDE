# Posterior inference for sparse hierarchical non-stationary models

This repository contains supplementary material for the article: ["Posterior inference for sparse hierarchical non-stationary models"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947320300451) 

Includes the 3 MCMC sampler used in the simulations:

- MWG: adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs scheme
- Marginal: marginal sampler with elliptical slice sampling (ELL-SS) for a re-parametrised length-scale process
- Whitened: elliptical slice sampling (ELL-SS) combined with re-parametrisations for decoupling the prior, hyperprior, and hyperparameters
